Sail n' Shoot is a turn-based, 2D ship combat game where the player
and the enemy starts at opposite sides of the "field", a 2D tile plane of customizable size.

Each turn they will each input a move command(forward, left, right) or an action command(fire, brace, use item, pickup item) 
The enemy's command will then be executed before the players own commands

The map will after all commands have been executed move both ships one tile forward.

This repeats until 1 ship is sunk, one boards the other or a ship reach the end of the field, where they will be turned around to repeat the process.

Winning is done by reducing your opponents life to 0.

The configuration file can adjust map size, numb. of items, numb. of enemies
